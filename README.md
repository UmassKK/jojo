JoJo's labview work





\

\
How to \
 \
-File path names and file names need to be entered \
-Command line prompt will need to be edited to use Windows commands on a Windows device\
-The button on the front panel in "jojo_0802_copy.vi" is used to open the front panel of a Sub VI to view graphs in real time if necessary\
-The VI will produce graphs from the random number generators versus the time that the numbers were generated\
-The wires that put the elapsed time into the arrays should not be replaced\
-The random number generators can be changed\
-The timing information is saved to a file when the run is stopped\
-
\
\
Sub VIs\
\
-"fileactionselector(SubVI).vi" creates a file after a name is entered, updates a file, or adds an increasing number to the end of an entered file name\
-"makeplots(SubVI).vi" builds arrays and creates mixed signal graphs for the information against time\
\
\
Notes\
\
-"jojo_original.vi" has a block diagram without the Sub VIs\
-"jojo_0802_copy.vi" includes the Sub VIs\
-I would like to organize the block diagrams better, especially the one with the Sub VIs\
